    Build a new character object with the appropriate class

    This derives the correct character class based on the type tag of either the
    other_char character object or the attributes dict, then creates a new
    character object using that class. If neither is supplied, a blank Character
    is returned.

    The character type is fetched first from other_char and only if that is not
    present is it fetched from attributes.

    Both other_char and attribuets are passed to the character constructor. See
    that for how their precedence is applied.

    If you need more control over the instantiation process, use
    character_klass_from_type and call the object manually.

    Args:
        attributes (dict): Dictionary of attributes to insert into the
            Character.
        other_char (Character): Existing character object to copy.
