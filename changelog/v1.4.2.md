# 1.4.2 [unreleased]

This version was never released publicly.

This was the last version which used the old manual method of changelog creation.

## Added

* The `race`, `age`, `employer`, and `job` tags will no longer give an "unrecognized tag" error when linting
* Now recognizes `.fate` and `.npc` file extensions
* Add `job` subtag for `employer` tag. This means the `employer` tag is now group-like

## Changed

* Improved documentation
* The `faketype` tag can now only appear once
* The YAML format is now the default for settings files and takes precedence over JSON
* Documentation is now exclusively in [ReadTheDocs](https://npc.readthedocs.io/)
* Finished documenting new character commands

## Removed

* No longer recognizes `.dfrpg` file extension. Use `.fate` instead.
* The QT-based GUI has been removed. I felt it was not adding enough value to the project to be worth the substantial extra effort required to maintain it. Removing it has the upshot of also removing PyQT as a dependency of the project, which should make installation much simpler. I hope to create a new GUI some time in the future, but it's not a priority.
