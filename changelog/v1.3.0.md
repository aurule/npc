# 1.3.0

## Highlights

This release features a brand new GUI based on Qt. It has character creation, character search, and basic campaign management, with more to come soon. This means that PyQt5 is now part of the installation requirements.

The CLI has a new `find` command which makes it easy to get character files based on their tags.

    - `init` has new `dryrun` and `verbose` flags
    - New `find` entry point for finding characters by their tag contents.
    - New `find_characters` function to search the tags of a set of characters and return matching objects
* Character class
    - New method `build_header` to create tags from a Character object
    - More validations

## Changed

* Settings
    - The changeling settings format now requires that kith names are grouped by seeming
    - Improved formatting for results from the changeling settings linter
    - Metadata blocks now contain the NPC version number
    - Changeling kiths can only appear under one seeming
* CLI
    - Moved CLI interface to its own module: `npc.cli`
    - The `--batch` and `--debug` options now live under each command. This means they must go after the command name instead of in front of it.
* Character class
    - Moved Character class to its own module: `npc.character.Character`
    - The `path` item in Character objects now has the same special handling as `description`
    - `has_items` will raise an `OutOfBoundsError` if `threshold` is less than 1
    - `valid` is now False until `validate` is called
    - `type` is now required to have a non-whitespace value
* Commands
    - Commands now live in their own package and some have been renamed
    - `init` command sets the `campaign_name` when creating the campaign settings file
    - `reorg` command had its `dry` flag renamed to `dryrun` to match the flag on `npc.commands.init`
    - Refactored `reorg`, `lint`, and `init` commands to use `Result.printable` instead of directly printing output
    - Reorganized commands:
        + `listing` is now in its own module as `listing.make_list`
        + `create_changeling` and `create_simple` now share a module as `create_character.changeling` and `create_character.standard`
    - Courtless status is shown in html and markdown character listings
    - First freehold is used when creating a character path
    - Character paths will try to add a directory matching the first `@foreign` tag, if present

## Removed

* The `npc.main` package is no more. To start the cli, use `npc.cli.start(argv)`
* Removed unused `default` arg to `Character.get_remaining`. It will always return an empty list if the tag isn't present.

## Fixed

* `Character.validate` correctly propagates the `strict` param to type-specific validators
* Passing None to `Character.append` will add the named tag with no data, so it acts as a flag
* Methods in `Character` will no longer add empty elements when called on non-existing fields
