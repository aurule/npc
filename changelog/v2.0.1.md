# Changelog for NPC v2.0.1

This is mostly a bugfix release, but the new `additional_files` for plots and sessions is a handy feature to have.

## Added

* Plots and sessions can now have additional files for each entry
* Documentation of internal API

## Fixed

* The plot file ((COPY)) placeholder was not respected
