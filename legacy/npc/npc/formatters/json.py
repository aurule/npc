"""
Formatter for creating json exports of a set of characters.

The functions in this module are very barebones and rely on json.dump to handle
the actual output. At most, they add some keys to the data first.

    Dump a json representation of all character data

        outstream (stream): Output stream
        metadata_format (bool): Whether to insert a metadata object. The

    basically anything. For compatability, however, the following format should
    be followed:

    The tables arg should be a dictionary of collections.Counter objects indexed
    by the name of the tag whose data is stored in the Counter. The tag name
    will be titleized and used as the header for that column of the report.
