  desc: The creature who takes the place of a changeling in the mortal world
  doc: >
    When a human becomes a changeling, a fetch almost always takes their place
    in the mortal world. Fetches are a strange reflection of the human and of
    the changeling; they need to blend in, but they are not at all mundane. Some
    know what they are and some do not, but all feel a unique terror if their
    changeling returns to the world.
