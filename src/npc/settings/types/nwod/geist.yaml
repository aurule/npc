geist:
  name: Geist
  desc: A ghost reshaped by the underworld into a representation of death
  doc: >
    Geists are ghost-spirit hybrid creatures created when a ghost spends far too
    long in the underworld. Some crave to feel life again, and make bargains
    with dying humans to share their bodies in exchange for a reprieve from
    death, creating Sin-Eaters or Bound.
