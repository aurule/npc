    path:
      desc: The mage's personal connection to magic
      doc: >
        Each mage has a path which reflects their primary relationship to and
        affinity for magic. The path is the connection through which they
        channel their magic, gain mana, and learn arcana.
    order:
      desc: A large group of mages who share a broad purpose
      doc: >
        Orders are the highest level of mage organization. Membership is common,
        but not required, and grants access to mentors, rotes, and resources.
    legacy:
      desc: Smaller, focused group of mages who pursue a shared mystical calling
      doc: >
        Joining a legacy transforms the mage's soul, making them a truly magical
        being instead of a mortal who channels magic. Membership grants unique
        powers and is sometimes seen as a rite of passage.
    shadowname:
      desc: Name for tha mage used among their peers
      doc: >
        Since names, especially true names, have power, mages make up a false
        name to use with others of their kind. The name can come from anywhere,
        but often has some personal meaning to the mage.
    nimbus:
      desc: Aura of power that surrounds a mage's soul
      doc: >
        A mage's nimbus reflects their personal practice of magic. Spells they
        cast incorporate their nimbus, letting it act as a sort of fingerprint
        on a spell. Though not visible, a nimbus can be detected by mage's and
        most supernatural creatures in some way.
