  tags:
    auspice:
      desc: Social caste based on the moon phase during the werewolf's first change
      doc: >
        A werewolf's auspice is more of a suggestion of role than a binding
        caste. Pure Tribes eschew auspice and do not have one.
      values: *auspices
    tribe:
      desc: Large social group that the werewolf belongs to
      doc: >
        Tribes are the high-level social structure among werewolves. Each
        follows a powerful spirit totem and shares certain ideals. Werewolves
        who claim no tribe are termed Ghost Wolves.

        Though Bale Hounds explicitly are not a tribe, it's still most helpful
        to note their affiliation under this tag.
      values: *tribes
    lodge:
      desc: Smaller social group with a narrow agenda
      doc: >
        Where tribes unite many werewolves under a large umbrella, lodges bring
        together only those who want to pursue the group's specific agenda. Most
        lodges exist within a tribe, but some bridge the tribes instead.
    pack:
      desc: Small group of werewolves who work together in a territory
      doc: >
        Packs are the core social unit of werewolves. They're based around a
        specific territory, both mortal and spiritual, which the pack members
        defend.
    protectorate:
      desc: Larger area made of the combined territories of multiple packs
      doc: >
        Essentially a shared territory.
