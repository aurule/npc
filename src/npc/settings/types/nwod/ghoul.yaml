ghoul:
  name: Ghoul
  desc: A mortal enhanced by, and dependent on, vampire blood
  doc: >
    By feeding a human some of their blood, and exerting their will, a vampire
    can bind that human to them as a ghoul. Ghouls do not age and are able to
    learn some of their vampiric domitor's disciplines.

    The ghoul must be fed vampiric blood every month, or they will lose their
    supernatural enhancements and rapidly make up the difference in age.
