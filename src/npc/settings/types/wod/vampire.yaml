        Sometimes vampiric lineage is a really big deal. Other times, it's just
        nice to know who's been fangin' around.
    clan:
      desc: The vampire's clan
    sect:

        role:
          desc: A high-level role the vampire fulfills within the sect
          doc: |
            Some roles are not limited to a single city, but are important to
            the functioning of an entire sect. Archons, Cardinals, and Prisci
            would be noted here.
    crew:
      desc: Name of the pack, gang, or coterie to which this vampire belongs
      doc: |
        Vampires often form small social groups so they can work together toward
        a shared purpose. They have different names in different sects, but the
        outcome is the same.
      subtags:
        role:
          desc: The role the vampire has in their crew
          doc: |
            Not all crews have distinct roles. This tag is primarily useful in
            Sabbat packs to note the ductus, abbot, and priest. It can also be
            used to note the less rigid roles certain vamipres play within their
            crew.
    city:
      desc: Name of the domain, diocese, etc. that the vampire calls home
      subtags:
        role:
          desc: The role the vampire has in their city
          doc: |
            This tag is best used for positions like prince, bishop, harpy, etc.
            that are only important within that city. If a position is
            recognized more universally, it's probably best represented using
            the title tag as well.
