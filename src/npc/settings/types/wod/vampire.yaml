vampire:
  name: Vampire
  desc: A blood-sucking creature cursed to the night
  doc: >
    Vampires are immortal denizens of the night. Once human, they were cursed
    with an unquenchable thirst for blood and forever bound to their inner
    beast.

    gen:
      desc: The vampire's generation
      doc: >
        A vampire's power is measured in part by how many steps removed they are
        from the mythical first vampire. Who that might be doesn't really
        matter. A vampire with a high generation of 12 or 11 is pretty typical,
        while a vampire with a low generation of 8 or 9 is able to wield
        significantly more blood powers.
    sire:
      desc: Name of the vampire who turned this character into another vampire
      doc: >
        Creating another vampire is called the Embrace. Sometimes vampiric
        lineage is a really big deal. Other times, it's just nice to know who's
        been fangin' around.
    clan:
      desc: The vampire's clan
      doc: >
        Almost every vampire is associated with a clan, a group of vampires who
        share a common heritage and set of powers. The clan also tends to come
        with certain social expectations and responsibilities, but those vary
        dramatically from the laissez faire Gangrel to the hierarchical Ventrue.

        role:
          desc: The role the vampire has within their clan
          doc: >
            Some clans, like the Assamites, have an internal hierarchy of power.
            While the role may not matter outside of the clan, a vampire's role
            within it may give them access to unique resources in exchange for
            extra responsibility.
    sect:
      desc: Major political body to which the vampire belongs
      doc: >
        Vampires are social creatures and whether they like it or not, have a
        habit of organizing themselves. In modern games, this tends to mean
        Anarchs, Camarilla, or Sabbat.
      subtags:
        status:
          desc: A status held by the vampire which is recognized in this sect
        role:
          desc: A high-level role the vampire fulfills within the sect
          doc: >
            Some roles are not limited to a single city, but are important to
            the functioning of an entire sect. Archons, Cardinals, and Prisci
            would be noted here.
    pack:
      desc: Name of the pack to which this vampire belongs (Sabbat only)
      doc: >
        Vampires often form small social groups so they can work together toward
        a shared purpose. In the Sabbat, these are called packs, and they are
        truly the cornerstone of the sect. Each pack is made official through
        repeated use of the Vaulderie ritus.
      subtags:
        role:
          desc: The role the vampire has in their pack
          doc: >
            Every pack needs three key roles filled: Ductus, Priest, and Abbot.
            The ductus guides the pack's actions, the priest sees to the
            members' spiritual needs, and the abbot provides shelter and worldly
            goods.
    gang:
      desc: Name of the gang to which this vampire belongs (Anarch only)
      doc: >
        Vampires often form small social groups so they can work together toward
        a shared purpose. Among the Anarchs, these are called gangs.
      subtags:
        role:
          desc: The role the vampire has in their gang
          doc: >
            Gangs have no formal roles or positions. Still, it can be useful to
            note the ad-hoc roles that emerge based on the gang's needs and
            actions.
    coterie:
      desc: Name of the coterie to which this vampire belongs (Camarilla, primarily)
      doc: >
        Vampires often form small social groups so they can work together toward
        a shared purpose. In the Camarilla, these are called coteries.
      subtags:
        role:
          desc: The role the vampire has in their coterie
          doc: >
            Coteries have no formal roles or positions. Still, it can be useful
            to note the ad-hoc roles that emerge based on the coterie's needs
            and actions.
    city:
      desc: Name of the domain, diocese, etc. that the vampire calls home
      subtags:
        role:
          desc: The role the vampire has in their city
          doc: >
            This tag is best used for positions like prince, bishop, harpy, etc.
            that are only important within that city. If a position is
            recognized more universally, it's probably best represented using
            the title tag as well.
