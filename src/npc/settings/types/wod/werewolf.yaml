      doc: >
        Werewolves are primarily organized into tribes, each of which follows a
        major spirit and claims a certain mystical lineage. Tribe mates
        typically have certain powers and outlooks in common.
    sept:

      doc: >
        The sept is the territory claimed by a group of werewolves. Usually this
        means multiple packs, but it can be as small as a single pack's
        territory. Septs can cover many miles of area and are always centered on
        a caern, a pure spiritual place.

          desc: The role of the werewolf within their pack
          doc: >
            Almost all packs have at least one role: the alpha. They direct
            their pack's actions and keep everyone focused. Outside of that,
            ad-hoc roles can easily spring up based on the needs of the pack.
