    Building on the success of the World of Darkness setting, White Wolf
    released New World of Darkness to unify the various monsters and allow
    shared play. It was rebranded later as Chronicles of Darkness and got a 2nd
    edition release.

    The New World of Darkness system defined here tries to capture the unique
    quirks of each character type by using lots of type-specific tags. It is
    only compatible with NWoD / CWoD 1st edition. CWoD 2nd edition uses
    different tags and different meanings for shared tags, so it does not work
    with the NWoD character types.
