    Building on the success of the World of Darkness setting, White Wolf
    released New World of Darkness to unify the various monsters and allow
    shared play. It was rebranded later as Chronicles of Darkness and got a 2nd
    edition release.

    The New World of Darkness system defined here probably works fine with
    Chronicles of Darkness, but was designed for NWoD 1st ed. It tries to
    capture the unique quirks of each character type by using lots of
    type-specific tags.
