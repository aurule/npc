        With whole classes built around worship, it can be very important to
        keep track of which god(s) a character prays to.
    monster:
      desc: Designate this as a generic sheet for a given type of monster
      doc: >
        It is very handy to have a way to represent the many monsters PCs fight
        in D&D, but these monsters are not necessarily real characters. More,
        they are often reused over and over again. This tag makes it clear that
        the given npc is more of a template than an individual creature with
        goals and motives.

        The value of this tag should be the "creature type" as listed in the
        monster manual, or other original source.
