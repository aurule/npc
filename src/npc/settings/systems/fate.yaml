  name: Fate Core
  desc: A rules-light storytelling system
  doc: >
    Fate Core is a dynamic and flexible roleplaying game built around proactive
    characters. Its mechanics allow play in any number of settings, from the mad
    science robotics of Atomic Robo to the superheroes of Venture City.

    Each setting for Fate usually includes some of its own rules, which might
    make it helpful to include new tags. Thus, Fate Core only has the most
    basic, universal tags and is designed to be extended by child systems.
