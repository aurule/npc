  desc: The original dark urban fantasy system for modern nights
  doc: >
    Created by White Wolf in the 1990s and updated with various releases, World
    of Darkness is *the* classic edgy low fantasy setting.

    This system tries to capture the unique quirks of each character type by
    using lots of type-specific tags. It is designed to be compatable with the
    1st edition Revised printing.
