  desc: Transhuman adventure in FATE
  doc: >
    Play as secret agents protecting the scattered remnants of transhumanity
    from threats that could wipe it out once and for all. You’re a transhuman --
    a genetically modified human, an intelligent animal, a mind in a robotic
    shell, or even a bodiless artificial generalized intelligence. Your body is
    heavily upgraded, and your mind can communicate with every electronic device
    around it. You need every advantage, because you’re up against mutants
    infected with an alien virus, WMD dealers, corrupted AGI god-minds, shifty
    amoeboid alien merchants, rampaging alien wildlife, and the ultimate threat:
    transhumanity’s own self-destructive capabilities.
