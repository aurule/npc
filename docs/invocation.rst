.. Core invocation documentation

Running NPC
===============================

NPC is mainly run as a command-line program. It also has a QT-based windowed application.

Command Line Interface
-------------------------------

The CLI is the main way to use NPC. Once installed, invoke it with ``npc [command]``. There are only a few universal options.

--campaign DIR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Change to the passed directory before running the command.

--help
~~~~~~

Show a help message and exit. This is supported for each command as well.

--version
~~~~~~~~~

Print the current program version and exit. Prevents any commands from running.

Graphical Interface
-------------------------------

The graphical interface is more limited than the CLI. It is invoked with ``npc-gui``.
