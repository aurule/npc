the recovery team in their investigation.

# Human

## Alkippe Anna

Human, Colonists

*Appearance:* The synth is heavily augmented compared to baseline models.

*Notes:* Alkippe is a veteran of many pre-fall conflicts. He has extensive 
knowledge of hardware fabrication, maintenance, military gear, and combat 
strategies. The Fall convinced him that transhumanity must move to the 
stars to avoid a repeat of that tragedy.

## Ekaitz Karyna

Human, Colonists

*Notes:* Ekaitz is a skilled xeno-technologist, skilled at making alien tech 
reveal its secrets. She was basically a groupie to the Pandora Gate decoding 
effort and got in on the ground floor of gatecrashing. Her klepto tendencies 
prevented her from rising too far in any of the gate corps, but her experience 
keeps getting her jobs.
