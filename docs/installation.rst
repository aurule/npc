Installing NPC
===============================

NPC is still in development mode, so binary packages are not yet available. Until the first release is published, you'll need to clone the repo, install python 3.11, and install the runtime dependencies from :file:`requirements.txt`.

Once installed, you'll have access to the ``npc`` cli utility. See :ref:`cli_home` and :ref:`guide_cli_quickstart` for an intro to using this program.
