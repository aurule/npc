CLI Commands
===============================

NPC has a command line program invoked as ``npc``. It provides many commands for interacting with campaigns, systems, and characters.

.. note::

	Some commands can only be executed within a campaign directory, or one of its subdirectories. When run outside of a campaign, these commands will show a warning and immediately exit.
