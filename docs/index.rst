Welcome to NPC's documentation!
===============================

NPC is a tool to make my life easier when I'm running tabletop RPG games. It automates and streamlines a few tedious tasks for me, like

- Creating new session logs
- Creating new plot planning files
- Creating and organizing character files
- Generating a list of characters to publish
- And more!

NPC is very much a personal project. It works well enough for me to use for my weekly games, and I think it might be useful for others. That said, if you use it and come up with suggestions or bugs, open an issue! I'll at least take a look!
