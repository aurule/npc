    .. tab-item:: CLI

        Navigate to the directory:

        .. code:: sh

            cd "My Campaign"

        That's it! All CLI commands will now work on the campaign you're in.

    .. tab-item:: GUI

        If the campaign is one you've opened recently, it will be listed as an option on the welcome screen, as well as under :guilabel:`&File > Open Recent`.

        Otherwise, go to :guilabel:`&File > Open Campaign` and browse to the campaign's folder.
