CLI Basics
==========

NPC comes with a command line utility, ``npc``. This is a fully featured program for interacting with campaigns. It's the original way to use NPC, in fact.

After :ref:`install`, you should simply be able to invoke ``npc`` from any command line. If not, check that your PATH includes ``npc``.
