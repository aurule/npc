    === Eclipse Phase: Transhumanity's Fate ===
    Transhuman adventure in FATE

    Play as secret agents protecting the scattered remnants of transhumanity from
    threats that could wipe it out once and for all. You're a transhuman -- a
    genetically modified human, an intelligent animal, a mind in a robotic shell,
    or even a bodiless artificial generalized intelligence. Your body is heavily
    upgraded, and your mind can communicate with every electronic device around
    it. You need every advantage, because you're up against mutants infected with
    an alien virus, WMD dealers, corrupted AGI god-minds, shifty amoeboid alien
    merchants, rampaging alien wildlife, and the ultimate threat: transhumanity's
    own self-destructive capabilities.

    Unlike other Fate variants, this system redefines the trouble and aspect tags
    as subtags of the character's concept and morph.
