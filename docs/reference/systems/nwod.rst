New World of Darkness
#####################

:bdg-info:`key: nwod`

Urban fantasy in the modern era

Building on the success of the World of Darkness setting, White Wolf released New World of Darkness to unify the various monsters and allow shared play. It was rebranded later as Chronicles of Darkness and got a 2nd edition release.
The New World of Darkness system defined here probably works fine with Chronicles of Darkness, but was designed for NWoD 1st ed. It tries to capture the unique quirks of each character type by using lots of type-specific tags.
