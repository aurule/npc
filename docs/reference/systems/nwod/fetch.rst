The creature who takes the place of a changeling in the mortal world

When a human becomes a changeling, a fetch almost always takes their place in the mortal world. Fetches are a strange reflection of the human and of the changeling; they need to blend in, but they are not at all mundane. Some know what they are and some do not, but all feel a unique terror if their changeling returns to the world.
