@nimbus

:bdg-secondary:`Optional`

Aura of power that surrounds a mage's soul

A mage's nimbus reflects their personal practice of magic. Spells they cast incorporate their nimbus, letting it act as a sort of fingerprint on a spell. Though not visible, a nimbus can be detected by mage's and most supernatural creatures in some way.
