Sin-Eater
#########

:bdg-info:`New World of Darkness`

A mortal who bound themselves to a geist through a bargain while on the brink of death

Sin-Eaters usually start as mortal humans with an affinity for the dead in some way. Then, when they died, a geist reached out to them with an offer: share your body with me, and I'll let you live again. Some take this bargain and become the Sin-Eaters.

Sin-Eaters are also known as Bound, though that word has a few meanings.
