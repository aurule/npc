Ghoul
#####

:bdg-info:`New World of Darkness`

A mortal enhanced by, and dependent on, vampire blood

By feeding a human some of their blood, and exerting their will, a vampire can bind that human to them as a ghoul. Ghouls do not age and are able to learn some of their vampiric domitor's disciplines.

The ghoul must be fed vampiric blood every month, or they will lose their supernatural enhancements and rapidly make up the difference in age.
