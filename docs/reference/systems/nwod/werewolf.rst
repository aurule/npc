New and Changed Tags
====================

.. _tag_nwod_werewolf_auspice:

@auspice
--------

:bdg-secondary:`Optional`
:bdg-info:`Value required`

Social caste based on the moon phase during the werewolf's first change

A werewolf's auspice is more of a suggestion of role than a binding caste. Pure Tribes eschew auspice and do not have one.


Allowed Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- irraka

- ithaeur

- cahalith

- elodoth

- rahu


.. _tag_nwod_werewolf_tribe:

@tribe
------

:bdg-secondary:`Optional`
:bdg-info:`Value required`

Large social group that the werewolf belongs to

Tribes are the high-level social structure among werewolves. Each follows a powerful spirit totem and shares certain ideals. Werewolves who claim no tribe are termed Ghost Wolves.

Though Bale Hounds explicitly are not a tribe, it's still most helpful to note their affiliation under this tag.


Allowed Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- blood talons

- bone shadows

- hunters in darkness

- iron masters

- storm lords

- fire-touched

- ivory claws

- predator kings


.. _tag_nwod_werewolf_lodge:

@lodge
------

:bdg-secondary:`Optional`
:bdg-info:`Value required`

Smaller social group with a narrow agenda

Where tribes unite many werewolves under a large umbrella, lodges bring together only those who want to pursue the group's specific agenda. Most lodges exist within a tribe, but some bridge the tribes instead.


.. _tag_nwod_werewolf_pack:

@pack
-----

:bdg-secondary:`Optional`
:bdg-info:`Value required`

Small group of werewolves who work together in a territory

Packs are the core social unit of werewolves. They're based around a specific territory, both mortal and spiritual, which the pack members defend.


.. _tag_nwod_werewolf_protectorate:

@protectorate
-------------

:bdg-secondary:`Optional`
:bdg-info:`Value required`

Larger area made of the combined territories of multiple packs

Essentially a shared territory.
