Eclipse Phase: Transhumanity's Fate
###################################

:bdg-info:`key: fate-ep`

Transhuman adventure in FATE

Play as secret agents protecting the scattered remnants of transhumanity from threats that could wipe it out once and for all. You're a transhuman -- a genetically modified human, an intelligent animal, a mind in a robotic shell, or even a bodiless artificial generalized intelligence. Your body is heavily upgraded, and your mind can communicate with every electronic device around it. You need every advantage, because you're up against mutants infected with an alien virus, WMD dealers, corrupted AGI god-minds, shifty amoeboid alien merchants, rampaging alien wildlife, and the ultimate threat: transhumanity's own self-destructive capabilities.
Unlike other Fate variants, this system redefines the trouble and aspect tags as subtags of the character's concept and morph.
