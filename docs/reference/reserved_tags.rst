Reserved Tag Names
==================

These tag names are used internally to describe certain aspects of a character, so they cannot be used for storing arbitrary data.

description
-----------

The ``description`` keyword is used to store all of the bare text in a character file's tag area. This is usually text about who they are, their history, what they want in the story, etc.

mnemonic
--------

The ``mnemonic`` keyword is used to store the reminder words in the character file name. These words appear after the ``" - "`` separator and are exposed through the character's ``mnemonic`` property.
