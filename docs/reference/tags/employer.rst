@employer
#########

:bdg-info:`Optional`
:bdg-info:`Value required`


Name of a person or organization that pays the character for work

This can have a lot of overlap with the character's orgs. Generally, if the character belongs to the group socially, then use the @org tag. If they belong to the group primarily for pay, use @employer. If they're dedicated to both the social aspect and the pay, then use both together.
Some characters are fully self-employed. For them, use "himself" or similar for the employer.

Subtags

These tags can appear immediately after @employer and will be associated with that tag instance's value.
