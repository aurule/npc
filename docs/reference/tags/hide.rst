Conceal the named tag from listings

For when you want a character to appear in the listing, but have some important details remain a mystery.

Individual tag values can be hidden using [tagname] >> [value]. Hide all subtags using [parent] >> [value] >> subtags, or hide single subtag with [parent] >> [value] >> [subtag value]
