Default Tags
==========================

These tags are available by default to all characters in all campaigns. Availability can be changed by individual game systems, character types, and campaigns.

See :ref:`ref_systems` for the game systems built into NPC.

    :hidden:
    :maxdepth: 1

Certain tags do not store data about a character, but instead control how NPC interacts with that character and its tags. These control tags are defined and used just like other tags, but *must not* be changed: :ref:`tag_sticky`, :ref:`tag_nolint`, :ref:`tag_delist`, :ref:`tag_hide`, :ref:`tag_faketype`.
