#####

:bdg-info:`Value required`

Name of a person to whom the character has a social connection

Useful for noting families and informal relationships that form outside of regimented groups.


Subtags
=======

These tags can appear immediately after @link and will be associated with that tag instance's value.

.. _tag_link_rel:

@rel
====

:bdg-secondary:`Optional`
:bdg-info:`Value required`

The nature of the relationship the character has to the linked person

This subtag should almost always be used, as the nature of a relationship is at least as important as the fact that it exists. Good for denoting parents, children, siblings, school rivals, nemeses, or pretty much any other kind of relationship.
