GUI Basics
==========

Although NPC started with just a command line program (see :ref:`cli_home`), it now features a graphical interface powered by Qt. This app works with the same campaigns as the CLI, but presents the information in a much more intuitive way.

While using the GUI, you can hover your mouse over nearly any element to see a tooltip about what it does. For a brief into to the program, see :ref:`guide_gui_quickstart`.
